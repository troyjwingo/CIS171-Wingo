## Analysis Steps


I had alot of trouble with this one. Animation is a concept that I'm struggling with. I used alot of guides and tutorials for thiis assignment as it was stumping me quite a bit. I did end up getting it to function, but with some missing functionality.

## Notes

With the time I spent trying to make the program function I did develope a deeper understanding of how Gregorian Calendar translates into the clock and thought that was interesting.
