# Grading Notes

Nice implementation! This looks great - very organized.
To compare our sort execution times, we need to have the exact same data input to each sort - the same numbers in the same order.
Since arrays are passed by reference, the first sort will update the array to be in sorted order - the next sorts are receiving different
data.
